# MigradocPdfSharp-FirstPageEx
This is a fork of MigraDoc (and PDFSharp) 1.32

This fork includes a modification in the DocumentObjectModel to allow for the first page to have different margins than the default set for all other pages.

This includes a modification in both MigraDoc.DocumentObjectModel.PageSetup.cs & MigraDoc.Rendering.FormattedDocument.cs.  All other files have not been touched.
